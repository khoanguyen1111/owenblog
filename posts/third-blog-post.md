# Welcome to my third week of coding
## lots of stress and still lots of confusion

of innocence and naive. Hello Kitty is an example of cuteness due to the energy of innocence and the color pink of the character, gives off the expression of cuteness. However, I read Sianne Ngai’s book titled “Walk 2020”, and her definition and understanding of cute in Ngai’s perspective. From Ngai’s point of view, cute can be broken down into three big categories. First is how is manipulative the cute can be, Ngai explains that products that marketed to be cute manipulate consumers and tackle their emotions. Second, cute can hurt gender dynamics. To further explain, Ngai says that often people see women as cute, meaning they are innocent and that puts a stereotype on women and limits their agency. Last is cute as an emotion, as vulnerability. It can downplay cute people, is not as dangerous, and is easily broken. Through Sianne Ngai’s lens, it is further and much more thoughtful thinking into the concept of cute. My perspective is more general but from Ngai is an explanation in much depth. 

Effective complexity was first introduced by two physicists, Murray Gell-Mand and Seth Lloyd. It is a measure of how much information is needed to describe something.  This problem looks at how things are organized and structured into a system of high effective complexity. In the system, it needs to have a balance of order, randomness, and interesting patterns. What it does not need is something too random that exists without any structure or a pattern that is too predictable. Effective complexity can be seen in Rafael Rozendaal's art, which his art have enough pattern but it does not seem to be easily predicted. 

Rafael Rozendaal's artwork titled “pink yellow blue” from my understanding can be categorized as cute in aesthetic. Cute like Sianne Ngai's point of view can be manipulative in emotions and can be seen as vulnerable. “pink yellow blue” Chose three light colors that not only calm your eyes but appeal to the emotions of innocence. From an effective complexity point of view, this project is well balanced because even though we can predict that color will change it only happens after we observe it for a long time to find a pattern. “pink yellow blue” Has its own level of randomness but not to imbalance so that the ball bounces create chaos for the whole art piece. This artwork if I were to re-create it I would love to keep the pastel color, it makes me think about the cute concept. In addition, the idea of randomness in the way that the color changes and the shape bounce off each other.
