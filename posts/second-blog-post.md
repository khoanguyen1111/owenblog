# WEEK 2 SUMMARY
Week 2 started and this week is full of works and syntaxes. Learning new materials was difficult because I was new to the concept of coding. The speed of class was really quick and I understood just enough at that moment in class but was not enough to fully understand to apply it to my knowledge. Everything on that day was so fast so I took time during week 2 to to read and re-learn what I had listened to in class. The process of re-learning indeed took longer because I only knew how it worked at that specific moment in class. Although it was difficult, I was able to understand better with revision. 

Since I had a bit of understanding, I then tackled the homework for the week. The first is to use it to organize the “falling falling” artwork. I managed to understand it but to my knowledge, I couldn’t complete it, and in addition to other workloads coming from other assignments I have decided to wait for week 3 and ask for a solution in class.

The second task is to remake an artwork from Rozendaal and this week I have chosen his “not never no”. In able to complete this task, I break the model down into smaller information to understand what do I need to make this art work. I notice that each time I refresh the site, the circle position changes and I understood that it must need a random function to: first=> make the circle in a random location, second=> make the circle have different colors everytime. Hence I started to run to Youtube to learn more about this function of random. I started to watched The Coding Train, where he taught how to create random circles without any overlap. Another inspiration that I have learn from is Back To Code with his tutorial and also p5js example library. I built my code based on my own understanding, even though it was not exactly like how Rozendaal did it but I still take it because it was how my knowledge at this point of the class. A way for me too kep track of my own learning!!
