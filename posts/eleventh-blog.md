## Big week with Big disccusion 
# Let me break it down

Digital infrastructure was introduced to our class during the earlier weeks but brought in to more depth during our class. Through each of our discussion that we had, I have learnt more about the problems and also the knowledge to explore more about the problem. The more I learnt and talked , the more I understand about the important of creative coding not restricted in our classroom but expand to the real world with actual world problems that concerns many. Like the problem of bringing digital literacy in to the earlier age. I have found that problem really important especially that the world from now to forward had so much potential for the digital world. The early the people get to understand digital literacy could save or could possibly turn the society on a negative side. Hence, I could not denied the important of creative coding to the digital infrastructure that is us and our future generation. Data and security can be easier to seek and fix through the form of creative coding. Data could be detect and visualized to be simple and fast and security breach could be less of a pain with algorithm detection errors be fasters and more efficient. 
All the good sides of how creative coding is contributing to the digital infrastructure is important. However I would also think as the practice gets more and more impactfcul day by day, it is also important of how we get educate so that information and knowledge will not be use for wrongful mindset. Getting educated and improving digital literacy at a young at is important so that as the generation growth, understanding right or wrong should be black and white without a grey part.
