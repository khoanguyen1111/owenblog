# THIS IS MY FIRST EVER DAY HEHE
## This could be the sub title of MY FIRST EVER DAY

_After my first session_, I have been **invested** in doing more p5.js code. However, learning a new skill like coding took a lot of time and dedication. Even though I liked what I saw in the first session, I needed clarification because of how many steps I had missed. Moving on from that I started to work on my homework and the first homework. Making a grid from a nested loop, I have no idea what it means so I started watching tutorials online.  Patt Vira is known for her quick explanation and it was one of many channels listed on our Canvas module. Through her explanation, I started to work on my code and worked side by side with her explanation. It was quick and simple and now I have made my first grid. I was able to mess around with other settings, I was able to make it bigger, add more grids, and expand or mini the size of the canvas. The first homework was short and simple and straightforward to the point, nothing much of a problem yet.

However, the second homework is to “recreate” the work of Rafael Rozendaal. Rafael Rozendaal has been working with creative code for years and tracking back at all of his work, none of it was easy to recreate and it took time and effort to recreate. Since all of his work is that difficult for a beginner I decided to pick something random and recent. His work title “only suddenly.com” is one of the most recent. His work from the thumbnail is easy to work it but however, the hard part is when I click in and find out. “only suddenly.com” is a ball bouncing inside of a box so I break his work into 3 major parts. First is the bouncing ball,second is bounce that ball inside a box and third is the ball have to change color when it touches the box. I dive into how to make that ball bounce. Making a ball bounce is one of the most basic code since the begin of the game Pong, so I started to look to find how I can make that ball bounce. I go to p5js reference for example and find what I need and I also go to Patt Vira for a tutorial to be able to understand what I am suppose to do to be able to write the code. I understand what I need to do to make the ball bounce around but until today I still need to know how to keep it in a box and changed it colors. Need to do more research on that.
